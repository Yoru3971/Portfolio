I enjoy tackling complex problems and transforming them into scalable and maintainable solutions.",
    "BIO_P3": "My curiosity and proactivity constantly push me to dive deep into Research and Development (R&D) in unknown areas. This has led me to tackle challenging projects, ranging from video game modding and reverse engineering to the implementation of RAG models integrating Artificial Intelligence."
